```

### Frame 1

```{r}
race %>% group_by(NAME) %>%
  filter(variable == "B02001_001") %>%
  kable()
```

*** 

This is the total population for each catchment county 

### Frame 2 {data-commentary-width=400}

```{r}
```

*** 

This is the total population for each race for each catchment county 

### Frame 3 {data-commentary-width=400}

```{r}
```

*** 

This is the total population of people age 55+ for each race for each catchment county
